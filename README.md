# Welcomt to our PIG dice game

Rules of the game are simple, first person to get a score of 100 wins, each turn you can roll a dice, if the dice lands on 1, the points from that turn become 0. Its a game about risk and strategy (and maybe some luck)

# About the project:

This is assignment is part of Methods for Sustainable Programming course DA115B.

Programming Language used: Python.

# For tester

We have added a "testing mode" in which the max score is set lower than 100 to make testing various combinatiosna and modes easier.
Generated coverage, UML charts and tests can be found in their seperate folders. For the best testing experiece use a venv to run tests 
and to make things easier you can run the command 
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

to install all the necessary packages to run the tests.
